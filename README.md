# Coach Code Land
This is a repo of my ["blog"](https://deaglegross.github.io/).

I am not pretending to be an expert - this is just a place, where I store abstracts of different courses\own discoveries and etc.
I would be happy if you find these materials useful. If you have any suggestion - please, submit an issue. Thanks!
